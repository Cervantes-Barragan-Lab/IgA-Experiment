<h1>Gut Microbiota and IgA Interactions</h1>

<p>This repository contains the code, data, and results associated with the research project focused on understanding the impact of the gut microbiome on immunoglobulin A (IgA) production and its interaction with dietary factors. The research aims to uncover the relationship between the gut microbiota, dietary fiber content, and the production of IgA, a critical antibody for maintaining gut immunity and defending against pathogens.</p>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The gut microbiome influences immunity and mucosal barrier maintenance in the small intestine. Changes in diet alter the gut microbiota composition, affecting the gut immune system and its constituents. This research investigates the impact of a low-fermentable-fiber diet on IgA concentrations in mice and explores the underlying mechanisms. Preliminary findings suggest lower concentrations of ileal and fecal IgA in mice on the low-fermentable-fiber diet, but the specific mechanisms remain unclear. The study aims to identify if changes in gut microbiota or B cell repertoire contribute to the observed IgA reduction.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Immunoglobulin A (IgA) plays a crucial role in defending mucosal surfaces against pathogens and maintaining host-microbiota homeostasis. The gut microbiota composition influences IgA production, and commensal bacteria like segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) modulate the intestinal immune system. Dietary fiber content is known to impact the gut microbiota and mucosal immune function. Low-fiber diets have been associated with reduced diversity, proinflammatory microbiota, and increased risk of inflammatory diseases. Understanding the effects of diet on IgA production can provide insights into immunodeficiencies and potential treatments.</p>

<h2>Research Approach</h2>
<p>The research utilizes a mouse model and compares mice on a standard chow diet (SCD) and a low-fermentable-fiber diet (LFF). Fecal and ileal IgA concentrations are analyzed to assess the impact of dietary fiber on IgA levels. Immunostaining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) are employed to identify bacterial taxa interacting with IgA and determine potential changes in the gut microbiota composition. Predictive models are developed to identify bacterial orders with high explanatory power in predicting IgA-producing immune cell frequencies.</p>
